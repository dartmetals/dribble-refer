            During your internship, you'll get the opportunity to work on meaningful projects that 
            have real business impact. Each intern is assigned a dedicated mentor who guides you 
            through project development, code reviews, and best practices. By the end of the internship, 
            you'll have completed at least 2-3 full-scale projects that you can proudly add to your 
            resume and portfolio. This practical experience is invaluable and will give you a significant 
            advantage in the competitive UK job market.
